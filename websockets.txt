Broadcasting: WebSockets can support broadcasting, where a single message sent by 
a client can be broadcasted to multiple clients simultaneously. This is useful for scenarios where updates need to be sent to multiple clients at once.

consumer : a python class that handles different types of asynchronous events,
including websocket connection ,http request and more
Consumers are used to manage interactions with clients over different protocols

Routes in Django Channels define how different types of asynchronous events are mapped to specific consumers. They are responsible for routing incoming 
connections and events to the appropriate consumer.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):
AJAX is a technique used in web development to update parts of a web page without requiring a full page reload.
